# BEST-20-.NET-CORE-LIBRARIES
.Net Core is a lightweight and cross-platform version of the DotNet framework and the wonderful thing is that Developers required the same expertise to code with .Net Core as .Net Framework.

With Every new Update, new features are added that help developers deploy high-performance & highly scalable applications using less Code.

In this article, We are listing down some of the most useful but not very commonly used .Net Core Libraries that every developer needs to know.
### LITEDB
**LiteDB** is a lightweight, small & fast NoSQL embedded database. It’s Open source & freely available for everyone, also for commercial usage. LiteDB is fast & also support LINQ queries. It stores data in documents & support Datafile encryption using DES (AES).

Like SQLite, LiteDB also stores data in a single file. It can also index document fields for fast search.
### CACHEMANAGER
**CacheManager** is an open source caching abstraction layer for .NET written in C#. It supports various cache providers and implements many advanced features.

CacheManager makes developer’s life simpler by handling very complex cache scenarios. It also provides the implementation of multiple layers of caching in just a few lines of code, e.g. in-process caching in front of a distributed cache.
### SMIDGE
A lightweight runtime CSS/JavaScript file minification, combination, compression & management library for ASP.Net Core. It supports compression, Minification & combination for CSS/JS Files. It properly configures client-side caching & persistent server-side caching.

Smidge is easily extensible. You can completely customize the pre-processor pipeline and create your own processors for any file type.
### BCRYPT.NET-CORE
A .net Core version of BCrypt.net, with enhanced features and security. Compatible with .net framework as well as .net core. It should be a drop-in replacement for BCrypt.net as the namespaces are unchanged.

### ASPNETCORE.DIAGNOSTICS.HEALTHCHECKS
This project is a BeatPulse liveness and UI port to new Microsoft Health Checks feature included on ASP.NET Core 2.2. It supports almost every commonly used database including MySql, Sql Server, Sqlite, MongoDB, Amazon S3, Postgres, Elasticsearch, DynamoDb & many other.

### FLUENTEMAIL
Send email from .NET or .NET Core. Many useful extension packages make this very simple and powerful. It also offers Email body as a template. We can also use a template from disk.
### UNITCONVERSION
UnitConversion is designed to be expansible through factories or through concrete converter implementations. It supports Mass Conversion, Time Conversion, Area Conversion, Distance Conversion & Volume Conversion.

### FASTREPORT
FastReport provides open source report generator for .NET Core 2.x/.Net Framework 4.x. You can use the FastReport in MVC, Web API applications.

You can get data from XML, JSON, CSV, MySql, MSSQL, Oracle, Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, Couchbase, RavenDB.

### AUTOCOMPLETE
A very simple, Persistent, powerful and portable autocomplete library. Ready for desktop, web & cloud. It Supports all stream types, including on classical disc storage for cheapest hosting. Considered as one of the fastest autocomplete algorithms with O(n) complexity for searching.

### APPMETRICS
App Metrics is an open-source and cross-platform library used to record metrics within an application. it provides several metric types to measure things such as the count of login users over time, the rate of requests, measure time to run a DB query, measure the amount of free memory and so on. It supports Counters, Meters, Gauges, Histograms and Timers etc.

### SHARPCOMPRESS
SharpCompress is a compression library that can unzip, unrar, un7zip, untar unbzip2 and ungzip with forward-only reading and file random access APIs. Write support for zip/tar/bzip2/gzip are implemented.

The major feature is support for non-seekable streams so large files can be done on the fly.

### HASHLIB
Here you can find implementations of many hashing algorithms e.g. all sha3 round 2 and 3 candidates. You can hash files, streams, common types of data.

### NOPCOMMERCE
nopCommerce is the best open-source e-commerce shopping cart. nopCommerce is available for free. It is a fully customizable shopping cart. It’s stable and highly usable. nopCommerce is an open source ecommerce solution.

nopCommerce can be up-and-running in just a few clicks. just download and follow the simple instructions. It’s also optimised for search engines & has friendly URLs.

### MAILKIT
The main goal of this project is to provide the .NET world with robust, fully featured and RFC-compliant SMTP, POP3, and IMAP client implementations.

### CSCORE
A free .NET audio library which is completely written in C#. it offers many features like playing or capturing audio, en- or decoding many different codecs, effects and much more!

### NETOFFICE
NetOffice supports extending and automating Microsoft Office applications: Excel, Word, Outlook, PowerPoint, Access, Project and Visio. It doesn’t have any version limitation. It supports Office versions from 2000 to the latest version.

### SSH.NET
This project was inspired by Sharp.SSH library which was adopted from java and it seems like was not supported for quite some time. This library is a complete rewrite, without any third party dependencies, using parallelism to achieve the best performance possible.

It provides SSH commands using Sync & Async methods. SFTP functionality also supports Sync & Async operations. Supports two-factor or higher authentication as well.

### SIGNALR
ASP.NET SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications.

“real-time web” functionality is the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

### C-SHARP-ALGORITHMS
A C# plug-and-play class-library project of Algorithms & standard Data Structures. It includes 30+ Algorithms & 35+ Data Structures designed as Object-Oriented separate components. Actually, this project was started for educational purposes, the implemented Algorithms & Data Structures are efficient, standard, tested & stable.

### NANCY
Nancy is a lightweight framework for building HTTP based services on .NET Framework/Core and Mono.

Nancy is designed to handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, & PATCH requests and provides a simple, elegant way for returning a response with just a couple of keystrokes, leaving you with more time to focus on the important logic of your application.
